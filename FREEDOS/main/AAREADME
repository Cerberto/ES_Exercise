In this exercise we discuss how to write a small program to calculate
the density of states of free electrons modifying the program illustrated in
LECTURE3 3.

We discuss the following subroutines:

free_dos.f90        ! the main code
freemod.f90         ! the data structure
input_free.f90      ! the input routine. Reads the information on the k path
accumulate_dos.f90  ! calculates the eigenvalues
deallocate_all.f90  ! deallocate variables
                  
For a discussion of the other routines see previous lecture.
To compile it you need a fortran90 compiler, such as gfortran.
Enter in the directory src, change the file compile if you use a compiler 
different from gfortran, and type . compile.
To run the code enter in the directory inputs and type:
../src/free_dos.x < input_? 
The output will appear in the file output.
To clean all outputs type . clean.

There are several inputs:

input_sc_dos   shows a simple input to obtain the dos of free electrons
TEST/test.sh   make a simple script to check the convergence of the DOS
               as a function of k points and sigma for three values of 
               the energy.
input_fcc_dos  show an input to obtain the dos of free electrons using
               the free electron bands for the fcc lattice.
input_sc_2d    show the 2D dos fixing k_z=0 and integrating in the plane.
input_sc_1d    show the 1D dos fixing k_y=k_z=0 and integrating along a line.
