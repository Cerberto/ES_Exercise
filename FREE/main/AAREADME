In this exercise we discuss how to write a small program to calculate
the band structure of free electrons.

We discuss the following subroutines:

free.f90             ! The main driver program
freemod.f90          ! contains the data structures of the program             
input_free.f90       ! the input routine. Reads the information on the k path
set_lattice.f90      ! calculates the direct and reciprocal lattice vectors
calculate_radius.f90 ! calculates the radius of the G sphere that
                     ! contains all the spheres |k+G|^2 < Ecut 
ggen.f90             ! calculates the list of G vectors    
set_hamiltonian.f90  ! calculates the eigenvalues
deallocate_all.f90   ! deallocate variables
                  
Then we need a few auxiliary routines copied from QE:

hpsort.f90   To order the k + G vectors
recips.f90   To calculate the reciprocal lattice vectors
kind.f90     The kind of the real numbers 

To compile it you need a fortran90 compiler, such as gfortran.
Enter in src, change the file compile if you use a compiler different from
gfortran, and type compile.
To run the code enter in the directory inputs and type:
../src/free.x < input_? 
The output will appear in the file output.
